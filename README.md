# social_media_analysis
About Project:
Project is based on web scraping and sentimental analysis. Primarily I used two websites:
1) Twitter
2) Tripadvisor

Important files and their functions:
1)tweety.py: This file is used for extracting reviews from twitter with the help of twitter API
2)twitter.ipynb: This file is for sentimental analysis based on twitter, using NLTK and Textblob
3)trip_reviews.ipynb: This file is for sentimental analysis based on hotel reviews which I scraped from tripadvisor.
4)trip.py: I used this file for scraping reviews from tripadvisor.
5)csv files: All csv files contains reviews/tweets which I extracted from both websites.

Results:
Results are displayed in the form of pie charts and bar graphs. No. of positive tweets are significantly higher than no. of positive reviews.
1) Percentage of positive tweets: 90.3%
2) Percentage of positive reviews: 79.0%
Reason for such behaviour could be that Twitter is social media platform, whereas TripAdvisor is review based website.
